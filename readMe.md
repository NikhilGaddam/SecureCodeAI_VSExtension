# SecureCode AI

SecureCode AI is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance software security by leveraging OpenAI's language models to identify and suggest fixes for security vulnerabilities in real-time during code development.

## Features

- **Real-time Vulnerability Detection**: Scans code as you write, identifying potential security threats such as SQL injections, XSS, and buffer overflows.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for code improvement to prevent security vulnerabilities based on the context of your current project.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within your VS Code environment without disrupting your workflow.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Effective across multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++.
